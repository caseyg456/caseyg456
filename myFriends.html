<h3>My Friends</h3>
<P>My friends and I can constantly be found playing pick up basketball, watching football or playing video games.
I met the majority of my friends through youth sports and we remanded very close through high school and into college.
During High School, my friends and I organized a pick up game of football to raise money for a local police officer with cancer.
    The game was high school students versus the Wrentham MA Police Department in a game of flag football.
The entire community came out for this game
    and we also got Patriots DE Rob Ninkovich to do the coin flip. This was a great night for a great cause and a very proud moment for my friends and I.</P>
