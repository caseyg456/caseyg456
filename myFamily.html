<h5> Family </h5>
<p>I have two older siblings, my brother Patrick and my sister Emily as well as a younger brother, Reid.
    My younger brother is currently a senior in high school while my older brother and sister both graduated from Worcester State and Clark University.
    Both of my Parents attended Framingham State University.  Every summer my family vacations in Lake Wakauwan, New Hampshire.
    The house we stay in has been in our family for more than 80 years and has been the highlight of my summer every time. I always enjoy fishing
hiking and kayaking while in New Hamoshire, while my brither prefer to spend there days out on the boat.</p>
