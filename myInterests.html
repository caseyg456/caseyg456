	<h3>My Interests</h3>
	<p>My interests include sports,politics, and video games.
From a young age I was always capitvated by sports,
growing up I played anything I could get my hands on from baseball to basketball, soccer, football, really anything.
As I grew up I focused on just baseball and basketball and played both throughout High School. I became interested in
politics during my first semester in college. I enjoyed watching the politicial debates and actively follow
many senate races. My interests in video games started at a young age, some of my favorite video games include
Madden, NBA 2k and Fortnite.</p>
